### KonnichiWave
[konnichiwave.io](http://konnichiwave.io)

This game was made to conform to the "Wave" theme at Global Game Jamin Menlo Park, CA.
You see your friends while walking around, and you have to wave back at them.
Waving makes you tired, collect coffee and energy drinks.
If you're fed up with your friends coming to bug you, hit TAB to change to 'annoyed' mode and flip them off so they leave you alone.
